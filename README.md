# This is my website!!

Hi, I'm un8qe. _(preferably unpronounced, but if you really need to read it, try pronounce each letter, one-by-one, like you're spelling it to a toddler)_ This is my home, autobiography, and archive on the information superhighway! I decided i would make this public to share my stuff with you, the new observer. You can go now. Nothing much. Just explore more of GitHub...

But **_you're_** still here. The people who wants to; either know more about me, or you just want my personal information. I'm from asia (yes, big place, vague as fuck, i know) and I can speak a specific tonal language. That's all i'm gonna tell you. So I'm currently in education, and my friends are probably the people who's going to collab with me in this repo, and note that i am writing this on a thursday night powered by caffeine, determination, and a pomodoro timer, with currently no collabs. So good luck with your lives, and get a move on, because I don't want you reading too much. It's uncomfortable to speak in someone's head every time they read these paragraphs, you know.

...

But **_you're_** still here... the true fans, the people who wants to read and know and is intrested and invested in me. So hey, you, I'm a ddlc fan, a miku fan, a doctor who fan (nuwho), a minecraft player, a cs2 player, i'm on reddit, discord, github (obv), youtube, instagram, etc.

Now really fuck off. I love you. <3
